# What Am I Trying to Say About "Taste"?

## The honest state

The post is drafted, set to `draft = true`, at `content/posts/stop-calling-it-taste.md`. Title: "Call It Judgement." Three SVGs, one photo, seven sections. It builds an argument. But the argument might not be the right one yet.

The discomfort: "I feel like I benefit from taste."

## What the post currently argues

"Taste" in AI discourse is gatekeeping dressed as discernment. What people mean is judgement — earned, learnable, specific. Bourdieu showed taste maps onto class position. Gramsci showed how cultural hegemony makes that mapping invisible. The word matters: "taste" is a gate, "judgement" is a ladder. Call it what it is.

Clean. Satisfying. Possibly too simple.

## The tension

You went to an elite school. You write with fluency that signals cultural capital. You use "taste" as an LLM prompt because it works. You've been on both sides of the gate — excluded in South Delhi for lacking cultural capital, included in North Delhi and Gurgaon. The post positions you as an outsider critiquing the system, but you're also an insider who benefits from it.

Bourdieu himself would point out: intellectuals critiquing bourgeois taste is itself a form of distinction. The critique is a move within the field, not outside it.

## Possible framings (unresolved)

1. **"Taste is gatekeeping, use judgement instead"** — current framing. Clean but possibly naive. Doesn't acknowledge complicity.

2. **"I benefit from taste and still think we should call it judgement"** — more honest. Harder to write. Requires sitting with the contradiction. Might be the strongest version because it doesn't pretend to be outside the system.

3. **"The word matters because it determines who feels invited"** — focuses on downstream effect rather than critique. Less theoretical, more practical. The closing already gestures at this: "a kid from a government school in East Delhi."

4. **"Naming the mechanism is the first step to opening it"** — Gramsci angle. Hegemony only works when invisible. The act of saying "this is cultural capital, not innate quality" is itself the intervention. Doesn't require you to be outside the system. Just requires you to name what the system is doing.

5. **"Judgement can be taught; taste can only be performed"** — makes the argument about what's actionable. Reframes the whole discourse from "who has it" to "how do you build it."

## Bourdieu concepts to sit with

**Symbolic violence** — when you accept "taste" as the frame for human value in AI, you participate in your own subordination. Junior devs who say "I just don't have taste" are committing symbolic violence against themselves. (PhilArchive piece: "accepting these dominant characteristics of taste is a form of symbolic violence")

**Embodied vs institutionalised capital** — you lacked the embodied (internalized dispositions, the culture) but had the institutionalised (the school name). The school name "breaking through" is one form compensating for the absence of the other. This is a precise Bourdieu distinction. Naming it would strengthen the school story.

**Habitus** — the deep structure. The South Delhi kids weren't performing culture. They'd absorbed it as habitus — responses that feel natural. That's why it looked innate. That's why people call it "taste" — because habitus *feels* like an innate quality to the person who has it.

**The field** — different social spaces have different rules for what counts as capital. North Delhi, South Delhi, Gurgaon were three different fields. Same person, different capital valuations. Tech is another field. The "taste" discourse is establishing what counts as capital in that field.
